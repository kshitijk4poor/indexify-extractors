# SciBERT Uncased

This is the pretrained model presented in [SciBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Scientific Text](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1371/), which is a BERT model trained on scientific text.
Works best with scientific text embedding extraction.

Example input:

```text
Scientific discovery is fascinating
```

Example output:

```json
"feature": {
        "feature_type": "Embedding",
        "name": "embedding",
        "data": [
          -0.07014346122741699,
