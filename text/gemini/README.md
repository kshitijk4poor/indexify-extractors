# Multimodal Gemini Extractor

This is an extractor that supports multiple kinds of input documents like text, pdf and images and returns output in text using Gemini from Google. This extractor supports various Gemini models like 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash and works on the Content of previous extractor as message, however we can manually overwrite prompt and message. Gemini has 1 million token context window that can process vast amounts of information in one go â€” including 11 hours of audio transcript, codebases with over 30,000 lines of code or over 700,000 words.

### Example:
##### input:
```
prompt = """Extract all text from the document."""
f = open("resume.pdf", "rb")
pdf_data = Content(content_type="application/pdf", data=f.read())
input_params = GeminiExtractorConfig(system_prompt=prompt)
extractor = GeminiExtractor()
results = extractor.extract(pdf_data, params=input_params)
print(results)

prompt = """Extract all named entities from the text."""
article = Content.from_text("My name is Rishiraj and I live in India.")
input_params = GeminiExtractorConfig(system_prompt=prompt)
extractor = GeminiExtractor()
results = extractor.extract(article, params=input_params)
print(results)
```

##### output:
```
