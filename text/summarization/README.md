# BART based Summary Extractor

This is a BART based Summary Extractor that can convert text from Audio, PDF and other files to their summaries. For summary extraction we use [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) which is a strong summarization model trained on English news articles. Excels at generating factual summaries. For chunking we use FastRecursiveTextSplitter along with support for LangChain based text splitters.

### Example:
##### input:
```
Content(content_type="text/plain", data=article)
```

##### output:
```
[Content(content_type='text/plain', data=b' Liana Barrientos has been married 10 times, sometimes within two weeks of each other. Prosecutors say the marriages were part of an immigration scam.
